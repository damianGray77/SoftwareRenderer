Quite a few years ago, I started working on a hobby project software rasterizer, which is still up on GitHub. I hit a point and lost interest in the project, leaving it abandoned.

I came back around to the subject and decided to rewrite from scratch with a greater emphasis on performance, coupled with a few more years of experience as a developer. This is still just a hobby and a very early WIP, but I am hoping to learn from it, and maybe get it to the point where it could be semi-useful... or at least as useful as a hobby software rasterizer can be in this say and age.
